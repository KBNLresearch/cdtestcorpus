This howto explains how to build 'jpylyzer' as a 32-bit Windows 
executable so that Python is no longer a dependency. Procedure described 
here will also pack binaries in a distribution-ready ZIP file. 

This was tested under Windows 7 using PyInstaller 2.0. (I haven't found 
a way to build actual Win64 binaries, since the build packages don't 
appear to support this yet). For older PyInstaller versions (1.5) things 
are a bit more complicated, so use version 2 if possible. 

SET-UP AND CONFIGURATION (YOU ONLY NEED TO GO THROUGH THESE STEPS ONCE): 

1. Download and install 'PyWin32' (Python for Windows extensions) from: 

http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/ 

2. Download 'pyinstaller' from 

http://www.pyinstaller.org/ 

3. Unpack/unzip it with your favourite file archive manager. PyInstaller 
is now ready for use. 

4. Open the batch file 'buildWin32.bat' which is part of the jpylyzer 
distribution, and update the configuration variables 'python' and 
'pathPyInstaller' according to your own system 

BUILDING THE WIN32 DISTRIBUTION: 

1. Run the batch file from the repo's root dir ( i.e. the one in which
it is located): 

buildWin32.bat 

2. Look at the zip file in the directory 'dist_win32'. 

Voila!
