## About this repo

The contents of this repo (data, script) can be used to create test CDs in a number of different CD layouts. The script uses [mkisofs](http://linux.die.net/man/8/mkisofs) and [wodim](http://linux.die.net/man/1/wodim). More materials will be added over time.

## Using the script

Download the contents of this repo or clone it with Git. Then run the shell script on a machine with a CD/DVD writer. Before running the script check the value of the `cdDevice` variable and modify it if necessary. The script prompts the user to insert a new blank CD after the previous one is written.
